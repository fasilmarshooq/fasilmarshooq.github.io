In today's competitive job market, it's not uncommon for a single job posting to receive thousands of applications. For example, Company A might receive around 2,000 applications for a single job post. Manually reviewing each resume is not feasible, so many companies turn to AI-powered CV screening tools like Greenhouse to streamline the process.

These tools use algorithms to scan and evaluate resumes based on predefined criteria, ensuring that only the most relevant candidates make it through to the next stage. However, many resumes are not structured or written in a way that these AI tools can effectively parse and evaluate. This can result in qualified candidates being overlooked simply because their resumes don't meet the machine's criteria.

Let's take a closer look at how these tools work and what you can do to optimize your resume for AI screening.
