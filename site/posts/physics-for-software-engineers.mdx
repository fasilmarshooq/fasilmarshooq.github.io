Last week, our team was deep in the trenches, working on a multi-DC event-driven system designed to power booking searches.

As part of the process, I was testing replication delays between our data centers in Hong Kong and Ashburn. The dashboard proudly displayed a maximum delay of **17ms**.

Cue one of our lead engineers chiming in: "Anything under 100ms is physically impossible."

My confident response? "Trust me, bro." ðŸ˜…

Then came the mic-drop moment from my director:

> "I trust the speed of light more than you."

**Big facepalm moment.**

## Let's Do the Math

The distance between Hong Kong and Ashburn is about **13,100 km**.

Light travels at **300,000 km/s**.

In theory (vacuum conditions), it would take roughly **45ms** for light to cover that distance.

```
Distance: 13,100 km
Speed of light: 300,000 km/s
Theoretical minimum: 13,100 Ã· 300,000 = 0.044 seconds = 44ms
```

Add in real-world factors (fiber-optic cables, signal processing delays, and the absence of a magic vacuum tube), and even 45ms is optimistic.

## The Reality Check

So, yeah... that 17ms? Either our dashboard is defying the laws of physics, or we've just rewritten them. (I'll let you guess which.) ðŸ˜…
