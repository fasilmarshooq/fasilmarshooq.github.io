For example, Company A might receive around 2,000 applications for a single job post. Manually reviewing each resume is not feasible, so many companies turn to AI-powered CV screening tools like Greenhouse to streamline the process.\r\n\r\nThese tools use algorithms to scan and evaluate resumes based on predefined criteria, ensuring that only the most relevant candidates make it through to the next stage. However, many resumes are not structured or written in a way that these AI tools can effectively parse and evaluate. This can result in qualified candidates being overlooked simply because their resumes don't meet the machine's criteria.\r\n\r\nLet's take a closer look at how these tools work and what you can do to optimize your resume for AI screening.\r\n\r\nLets consider this resume, This is from my former collegue. All PII data redacted for obvious reasons.\r\nHe is a fantastic back end engineer, one of the best i have worked with, will he be part of my dream team ofcourse yes!!\r\n\r\n---\r\n![Image](./images/example-resume.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n  \r\nBut machines dont understand relationship dynamics, let see how it reads.\r\n\r\nConsider the following automated review for a Senior Software Engineer position at Company A:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAutomated Review for Application ID *******, Job Pool [BE] Senior Software Engineer\r\n\r\nFeature evaluation:\r\n\r\n- Total working years -\r\n  5 years, Reason: Total working experience 5.25 years (including 2.25 years at ******* 0.75 years at *******, 2.25 years at *******)\r\n\r\n- Total years in last job -\r\n  2 years, Reason: Years in last job: 2.25 years at *******\r\n\r\n- Has any mentioned achievements, awards or recognitions -\r\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: Matches: | AdditionalInfo: The CV does not mention any of the listed achievements, awards, or recognitions.\r\n\r\n> This guy hasn't mentioned any of his achievements in the CV.\r\n\r\n- Has a job title tagged as back-end -\r\n  Requirement Passed: True, Reason: Found specified tag: IsBackendExperience in one of the job titles is true\r\n\r\n- Has been promoted? -\r\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not indicate that the candidate has been promoted within the same company.\r\n\r\n> Although he was promoted, the previous titles, roles and responsibilty is not mentioned in the cv.\r\n\r\n- Has a job title tagged as big data or distributed system -\r\n  Requirement Passed: True, Reason: Found specified tag: isBigDataOrDistributedSystemExperience in one of the job titles is true\r\n\r\n> This is important your resume should have key words from JD\r\n\r\n- Has completed any programming competitions -\r\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not mention any programming competitions.\r\n\r\n> Similar to achievements , these are also crucial but could be added advantage\r\n\r\n- Has experience leading a team or project -\r\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not provide any specific examples of the candidate leading a team or a project.\r\n\r\n- Has mentorship experience -\r\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not provide any specific examples of the candidate mentoring or leading junior engineers.\r\n\r\n- Has lead, principal or manager job titles on CV -\r\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The candidate does not have any job titles such as 'lead engineer', 'tech lead', 'lead developer', 'principal', 'engineering manager', or 'development manager' for more than 1 year.\r\n\r\n- Is currently working at company of interest -\r\n  Requirement Passed: False\r\n\r\nCV summary:\r\n\r\nThe candidate has a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology with a CGPA of 8.6.

The candidate has expertise in C#, .NET, SQL Server, LINQ, SSRS\r\n\r\nThe candidate has expertise in C#, .NET, SQL Server, LINQ, SSRS, Go, Kubernetes, Docker, and Websockets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Understanding the Automated Review Process\r\nThe automated review process evaluates various features of the resume to determine if the candidate meets the job requirements. Here are some key points from the example review:\r\n\r\n- Total Working Years: The tool checks the total years of experience and breaks it down by each job.\r\n- Achievements and Awards: The tool looks for mentions of achievements, awards, or recognitions.\r\n- Job Titles and Tags: The tool checks for specific job titles and tags related to the job requirements, such as back-end, big data, or distributed systems experience.\r\n- Promotions: The tool looks for evidence of promotions within the same company.\r\n- Programming Competitions: The tool checks for mentions of participation in programming competitions.\r\n- Leadership and Mentorship: The tool looks for examples of leading teams or projects and mentoring junior engineers.\r\n- Technical Papers: The tool checks for mentions of published technical papers.\r\n- Language and Visa Requirements: The tool verifies if the CV is in English and if the candidate meets visa requirements.\r\n\r\n#### Optimizing Your Resume for AI Screening Tools\r\nTo ensure your resume is effectively parsed and evaluated by AI screening tools, consider the following tips:\r\n\r\n- Use Clear and Consistent Formatting: Ensure your resume is well-structured with clear headings and consistent formatting. Avoid using complex layouts or graphics that may confuse the parsing algorithms.\r\n\r\n- Include Relevant Keywords: Use keywords and phrases that match the job description. For example, if the job requires experience in \"big data\" or \"distributed systems,\" make sure these terms are prominently featured in your resume.\r\n\r\n- Highlight Achievements and Awards: Clearly mention any achievements, awards, or recognitions. Use bullet points to list these accomplishments and make them easy to find.\r\n\r\n- Detail Your Job Titles and Responsibilities: Provide detailed job titles and descriptions of your responsibilities. Use tags or keywords that match the job requirements, such as \"back-end,\" \"full-stack,\" or \"data engineering.\"\r\n\r\n- Showcase Leadership and Mentorship: If you have experience leading teams or mentoring junior engineers, make sure to highlight these experiences. Provide specific examples and use relevant keywords.\r\n\r\n- Mention Technical Papers and Competitions: If you have published technical papers or participated in programming competitions, include these details in your resume.\r\n\r\n- Ensure Language and Visa Compliance: Make sure your resume is written in English and clearly states your visa status if applicable.\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\nIn today's job market, your resume is often the first point of contact with potential employers, and it's increasingly likely that it will be read by machines before it reaches human eyes. AI-powered CV screening tools like Greenhouse are used by many companies to efficiently process large volumes of applications. To ensure your resume stands out and makes it through the initial screening, it's essential to optimize it for these tools.\r\n\r\nBy using clear formatting, including relevant keywords, highlighting achievements, and providing detailed job descriptions, you can improve your chances of passing the automated review and getting noticed by hiring managers. Remember, your resume is a reflection of your professional experience and skills, so take the time to craft it carefully and make sure it effectively communicates your qualifications.\r\n"},{"id":"8887377c-ca56-56e8-92d2-b1df06f716b1","frontmatter":{"title":"Decoding the Developer Landscape - the Stack Overflow Survey 2024","date":"July 30, 2024","tags":["tech"]},"fields":{"slug":"/stack-overflow-survey-2024/"},"body":"\r\n[Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/) is out! Last year's survey provided insights into how developers around the world are embracing AI in their development processes. Let's find out what this year's survey has in store.\r\n\r\nAll views expressed here are opinionated and based solely on my experience.\r\n\r\n### Web Development Scene\r\n\r\n> JavaScript remains the most popular language this year.\r\n> Python is the first language of choice for learners.\r\n\r\nJavaScript is the language of the web, and it's here to stay. If you are a newbie developer, consider learning at least one JavaScript framework. According to the survey, **React.js** is still the number one preferred framework among professional developers worldwide. **Node.js** remains the preferred JavaScript runtime/JavaScript backend, but there is a significant shift towards **Next.js**.\r\n\r\nAt last year's Agoda Dev Day, there was a quiz question: which is older, Python or Java? Most developers jumped on Java, thinking it's the ancient beast we all know, but in reality, Python is older than Java 🐍. Sorry, Java! Once again, Python finds its way into many university curriculums, and with abundant learning content on YouTube, it's no wonder Python is the number one language for learners.\r\n\r\n![Image](./images/top-fw-so-survey-2024.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Docker remains the most used tool among developers.\r\n\r\nLearning Docker is crucial for any developer. I have experienced both worlds where deployment happens with MSI installers or sometimes ZIP files deployed through Octopus Deploy, but I would choose Docker for development any day. Containers play a key role in my development experience, from test containers to production environments. Since Docker is no longer free, we use Docker in WSL for Windows and OrbStack for Mac development.\r\n\r\n#### What's the Scene on Databases?\r\n\r\n> PostgreSQL debuted in the developer survey in 2018 when 33% of developers reported using it, compared with the most popular option that year: MySQL, in use by 59% of developers. Six years later, PostgreSQL is used by 49% of developers and is the most popular database for the second year in a row.\r\n\r\nMy colleague at Agoda was showing some performance results between SQL Server and PostgreSQL for some of our use cases. The results are stunning, though it's early to comment on the final outcome. My experience with PostgreSQL has been positive. At the very least, you save a ton of money on licensing 🤣, and performance is an added advantage.\r\n\r\n#### What About the Pay of Developers Using These Technologies?\r\n\r\nJavaScript developers' salaries have gone down in the new survey. I see a problem here, With the advent of AI tools like Co-pilot, any back-end developer can comfortably code in the front end when you have a proper design system in place. Does this mean the need for pure front-end developers is decreasing? Yes, at least according to the survey.\r\n\r\n> Full-stack, back-end, and front-end developers were the top three roles reported by developers for the last three years; however, front-end developers have decreased from 6.6% to 5.6% since last year.\r\n\r\nThis survey on developer pay should be taken with a pinch of salt. Most of the languages that attract high pay are niche and not widely used. According to the survey, even the poster boys Rust and Go have seen a decrease in salary 🤣.\r\n\r\n![Image](./images/top-pay-so-survey-2024.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am concerned that Stack Overflow didn't include any survey questions on testing and deployment tools and strategies, which are highly important. Given the increased amount of code being written and deployed to production since the advent of AI tools, these topics are crucial. I hope they make it into the survey next time.\r\n\r\n#### What's the Scene on AI Tools for Development?\r\n\r\n> 76% of all respondents are using or are planning to use AI tools in their development process this year, an increase from last year (70%). Many more developers are currently using AI tools this year, too (62% vs. 44%).\r\n\r\nOne tool that deserves my love among the AI tools mentioned in the survey is **GitHub Co-pilot**. I can't stress enough how much development effort it saves for me.\r\n\r\nGitHub provides a one-month free subscription to Co-pilot. Try it out. If you are an engineering leader and you are reading this, hands down, Co-pilot improves developer experience. Happy developers lead to a better product.\r\n\r\nThis is not a product advertisement 🤭. And no, Co-pilot is not an overhyped auto-completion tool.\r\n\r\n![Image](./images/top-ai-tool-so-survey-2024.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAgoda is doing a ton of things using ChatGPT. I'll write a blog about it later, or I can share one if my colleagues write one.\r\n\r\n> 70% of professional developers do not perceive AI as a threat to their job.\r\n\r\nFinally, fellow developers are embracing AI and accepting the fact that it's a tool. Some inner peace ✌️\r\n\r\nI'll repeat one more time, **embrace AI**.\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 provides valuable insights into the current state of the developer ecosystem. From the enduring popularity of JavaScript and the rise of Python as the first language of choice for learners, to the increasing use of Docker and the evolving role of AI tools like GitHub Co-pilot, this year's survey highlights several important trends. It's clear that AI is being embraced as a valuable asset, with 70% of professional developers not seeing it as a threat to their jobs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the survey did not cover testing and deployment tools and strategies—an oversight that is particularly significant given the increased volume of code being pushed to production with the help of AI tools. Hopefully, this will be addressed in future surveys. For more insights on methodologies, communities, and work environments, check out the full survey here. In summary, the key takeaway is to embrace change and continue to evolve as a developer.\r\n"}]}}}
