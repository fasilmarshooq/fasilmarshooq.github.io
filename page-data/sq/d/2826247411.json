Last year's survey provided insights into how developers around the world are embracing AI in their development processes. Let's find out what this year's survey has in store.\n\nAll views expressed here are opinionated and based solely on my experience.\n\n### Web Development Scene\n\n> JavaScript remains the most popular language this year.\n> Python is the first language of choice for learners.\n\nJavaScript is the language of the web, and it's here to stay. If you are a newbie developer, consider learning at least one JavaScript framework. According to the survey, **React.js** is still the number one preferred framework among professional developers worldwide. **Node.js** remains the preferred JavaScript runtime/JavaScript backend, but there is a significant shift towards **Next.js**.\n\nAt last year's Agoda Dev Day, there was a quiz question: which is older, Python or Java? Most developers jumped on Java, thinking it's the ancient beast we all know, but in reality, Python is older than Java 🐍. Sorry, Java! Once again, Python finds its way into many university curriculums, and with abundant learning content on YouTube, it's no wonder Python is the number one language for learners.\n\n![Image](./images/top-fw-so-survey-2024.png)\n\n---\n\n> Docker remains the most used tool among developers.\n\nLearning Docker is crucial for any developer. I have experienced both worlds where deployment happens with MSI installers or sometimes ZIP files deployed through Octopus Deploy, but I would choose Docker for development any day. Containers play a key role in my development experience, from test containers to production environments. Since Docker is no longer free, we use Docker in WSL for Windows and OrbStack for Mac development.\n\n#### What's the Scene on Databases?\n\n> PostgreSQL debuted in the developer survey in 2018 when 33% of developers reported using it, compared with the most popular option that year: MySQL, in use by 59% of developers. Six years later, PostgreSQL is used by 49% of developers and is the most popular database for the second year in a row.\n\nMy colleague at Agoda was showing some performance results between SQL Server and PostgreSQL for some of our use cases. The results are stunning, though it's early to comment on the final outcome. My experience with PostgreSQL has been positive. At the very least, you save a ton of money on licensing 🤣, and performance is an added advantage.\n\n#### What About the Pay of Developers Using These Technologies?\n\nJavaScript developers' salaries have gone down in the new survey. I see a problem here, With the advent of AI tools like Co-pilot, any back-end developer can comfortably code in the front end when you have a proper design system in place. Does this mean the need for pure front-end developers is decreasing? Yes, at least according to the survey.\n\n> Full-stack, back-end, and front-end developers were the top three roles reported by developers for the last three years; however, front-end developers have decreased from 6.6% to 5.6% since last year.\n\nThis survey on developer pay should be taken with a pinch of salt. Most of the languages that attract high pay are niche and not widely used. According to the survey, even the poster boys Rust and Go have seen a decrease in salary 🤣.\n\n![Image](./images/top-pay-so-survey-2024.png)\n\n---\n\nI am concerned that Stack Overflow didn't include any survey questions on testing and deployment tools and strategies, which are highly important. Given the increased amount of code being written and deployed to production since the advent of AI tools, these topics are crucial. I hope they make it into the survey next time.\n\n#### What's the Scene on AI Tools for Development?\n\n> 76% of all respondents are using or are planning to use AI tools in their development process this year, an increase from last year (70%). Many more developers are currently using AI tools this year, too (62% vs. 44%).\n\nOne tool that deserves my love among the AI tools mentioned in the survey is **GitHub Co-pilot**. I can't stress enough how much development effort it saves for me.\n\nGitHub provides a one-month free subscription to Co-pilot. Try it out. If you are an engineering leader and you are reading this, hands down, Co-pilot improves developer experience. Happy developers lead to a better product.\n\nThis is not a product advertisement 🤭. And no, Co-pilot is not an overhyped auto-completion tool.\n\n![Image](./images/top-ai-tool-so-survey-2024.png)\n\n---\n\nAgoda is doing a ton of things using ChatGPT. I'll write a blog about it later, or I can share one if my colleagues write one.\n\n> 70% of professional developers do not perceive AI as a threat to their job.\n\nFinally, fellow developers are embracing AI and accepting the fact that it's a tool. Some inner peace ✌️\n\nI'll repeat one more time, **embrace AI**.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 provides valuable insights into the current state of the developer ecosystem. From the enduring popularity of JavaScript and the rise of Python as the first language of choice for learners, to the increasing use of Docker and the evolving role of AI tools like GitHub Co-pilot, this year's survey highlights several important trends. It's clear that AI is being embraced as a valuable asset, with 70% of professional developers not seeing it as a threat to their jobs.\n\nHowever, the survey did not cover testing and deployment tools and strategies—an oversight that is particularly significant given the increased volume of code being pushed to production with the help of AI tools. Hopefully, this will be addressed in future surveys. For more insights on methodologies, communities, and work environments, check out the full survey here. In summary, the key takeaway is to embrace change and continue to evolve as a developer.\n"},{"id":"5b8a42fe-80a6-5278-aa72-8ffb268cc238","frontmatter":{"title":"Your Resumes are read by machines","date":"July 22, 2024","tags":["general"]},"fields":{"slug":"/your-resumes-are-read-by-machines/"},"body":"\nIn today's competitive job market, it's not uncommon for a single job posting to receive thousands of applications. For example, Company A might receive around 2,000 applications for a single job post. Manually reviewing each resume is not feasible, so many companies turn to AI-powered CV screening tools like Greenhouse to streamline the process.\n\nThese tools use algorithms to scan and evaluate resumes based on predefined criteria, ensuring that only the most relevant candidates make it through to the next stage. However, many resumes are not structured or written in a way that these AI tools can effectively parse and evaluate. This can result in qualified candidates being overlooked simply because their resumes don't meet the machine's criteria.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how these tools work and what you can do to optimize your resume for AI screening.\n\nLets consider this resume, This is from my former collegue. All PII data redacted for obvious reasons.\nHe is a fantastic back end engineer, one of the best i have worked with, will he be part of my dream team ofcourse yes!!\n\n---\n![Image](./images/example-resume.png)\n\n---\n  \nBut machines dont understand relationship dynamics, let see how it reads.\n\nConsider the following automated review for a Senior Software Engineer position at Company A:\n\n---\n\nAutomated Review for Application ID *******, Job Pool [BE] Senior Software Engineer\n\nFeature evaluation:\n\n- Total working years -\n  5 years, Reason: Total working experience 5.25 years (including 2.25 years at ******* 0.75 years at *******, 2.25 years at *******)\n\n- Total years in last job -\n  2 years, Reason: Years in last job: 2.25 years at *******\n\n- Has any mentioned achievements, awards or recognitions -\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: Matches: | AdditionalInfo: The CV does not mention any of the listed achievements, awards, or recognitions.\n\n> This guy hasn't mentioned any of his achievements in the CV.\n\n- Has a job title tagged as back-end -\n  Requirement Passed: True, Reason: Found specified tag: IsBackendExperience in one of the job titles is true\n\n- Has been promoted? -\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not indicate that the candidate has been promoted within the same company.\n\n> Although he was promoted, the previous titles, roles and responsibilty is not mentioned in the cv.\n\n- Has a job title tagged as big data or distributed system -\n  Requirement Passed: True, Reason: Found specified tag: isBigDataOrDistributedSystemExperience in one of the job titles is true\n\n> This is important your resume should have key words from JD\n\n- Has completed any programming competitions -\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not mention any programming competitions.\n\n> Similar to achievements , these are also crucial but could be added advantage\n\n- Has experience leading a team or project -\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not provide any specific examples of the candidate leading a team or a project.\n\n- Has mentorship experience -\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The CV does not provide any specific examples of the candidate mentoring or leading junior engineers.\n\n- Has lead, principal or manager job titles on CV -\n  Requirement Passed: False, Reason: The candidate does not have any job titles such as 'lead engineer', 'tech lead', 'lead developer', 'principal', 'engineering manager', or 'development manager' for more than 1 year.\n\n- Is currently working at company of interest -\n  Requirement Passed: False\n\nCV summary:\n\nThe candidate has a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology with a CGPA of 8.6.

Let's face it: all systems have security flaws, but we should make it difficult for attackers.\n\nSo, what can we do? Well, we can do many things, but the easiest go-to answer is \"Multi-Factor Authentication\" (MFA).\n\n![dog-mfa](./images/mfa-dog.png)\n\n<br />\nAttention 🚨 - MFA is not a replacement for allowing users to create weak passwords.\n\nThere are multiple ways to enable MFA. Let's explore a few of them.\n\n### Email Based OTP\n\nAn OTP will be delivered to the registered email. Accessibility is a pro here, as most users have an email account. However, you need to set up SMTP, store the OTP to validate it later, and be aware that emails can be compromised.\n\n### Sms Based Otp\n\nAn OTP will be delivered to the registered mobile number. It's easy to use and poses a lesser security risk than email-based OTPs. But... there are high costs involved.\n\nSo, this leaves us to select a solution that should be cost-effective and easy to use.\n\n### Introducing TOTP!!!\n\nTime-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) are randomized numeric codes generated by authenticator apps like [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) and [Microsoft Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en). These codes are generated based on a shared secret and a time counter, which means a new OTP is typically generated every 30 seconds. The OTP is valid only for the allotted time window, beyond which it becomes redundant, preventing OTP reuse.\n\n#### Fun Fact!\n\nThe first TOTP authentication system was developed, patented, and marketed by RSA Security. Later, the Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH) developed its own variant of TOTP, which it made freely available. I hope many of you have seen the image below 😆\n\n![dog-mfa](./images/rsa.png)\n\n<br />\nLet's see how we can implement one. I'm using C# here as an example, but it should\nbe pretty much the same across platforms.\n\nBelow is the basic user journey for registration and authentication:\n\n![mfa-flow](./images/mfa-flow.png)\n\n<br />\n\n```csharp\nusing OtpNet;\nusing QRCoder;\n```\n\n<br />\nWe are using [otp.net](https://github.com/kspearrin/Otp.NET?tab=readme-ov-file#totp-timed-one-time-password)\nand [QRCode](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder) here\n\n```csharp\nvar secret = Base32Encoding.ToString(\n                KeyGeneration.GenerateRandomKey(20)\n                );\n```\n\n<br /> The secret is generated using `KeyGeneration.GenerateRandomKey`. I would\nprefer one secret per user and store it securely after encrypting it using AES\nor other popular algorithms.\n\n```csharp var qrCode = GenerateQrCodeUri(\"some@email.com\",secret);\n\nstring GenerateQrCodeUri(string email, string secret)\n{\nstring issuer = \"my amazing app\";\nstring uri = $\"otpauth://totp/{issuer}:{email}?secret={secret}&issuer={issuer}\";\n\n    using (var qrGenerator = new QRCodeGenerator())\n    {\n    \tvar qrCodeData = qrGenerator.CreateQrCode(uri, QRCodeGenerator.ECCLevel.Q);\n    \tvar qrCode = new Base64QRCode(qrCodeData);\n    \treturn qrCode.GetGraphic(20);\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n<br /> With the help of QRCoder, we can generate a QR code. Below is the output\nfrom the above code, which you can scan using authenticator apps.\n\n![mfa-qr](./images/mfa-qr.png)\n\n<br />\n\nOnce you have scanned the QR code, it will appear in authenticator apps like the one below. Oh yeah, the screenshot below is taken from the Chrome Google Authenticator extension.\n\n![mfa-auth](./images/mfa-auth.png)\n\n<br />\n\nNow you have a time-based OTP. Let's see how to validate it.\n\n```csharp\nvar secret = \"my secure secret\";\n\nvar code = \"650260\";\n\nvar isValid = ValidateTotpCode(secret,code);\n\nisValid.Dump();\n\nbool ValidateTotpCode(string secret, string code)\n{\n\tvar totp = new Totp(Base32Encoding.ToBytes(secret));\n\treturn totp.VerifyTotp(code, out long timeStepMatched, new VerificationWindow(2, 2));\n}\n```\n\n<br />\n\ntotp.VerifyTotp will help us validate whether the input TOTP is valid or not.\n\nTada!!! With these easy steps, you have enabled MFA for your application.\n\nHaving MFA will not protect against impersonating cookies or JWTs. We will see how to make your JWT more secure in upcoming posts.\n"}]}}}
